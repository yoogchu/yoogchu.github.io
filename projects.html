                <td> A project that involves creating a live map for the managers of the Georgia Tech Department of Transportation to aid in the supervision of the drivers. It allows the managers to see which buses are lagging and/or consistently off schedule. The buses have tablets on them that transmit information such as location, speed, etc. and is collected in a database. </td>
                <td> I am working with a team of four to deploy the live map of the buses using Javascript and jQuery. I am also developing an algorithm to parse through large data sets to find inefficient drivers and misleading information. </td>

The patient could update his medical profile on the webapp, and view it on the iOS app. The patient could also view the doctors schedule and choose a time slot available for both of them to avoid any double-bookings. </td>
